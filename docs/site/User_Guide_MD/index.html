<p>The goal of the SMS_BP package is 3 fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Simulate motion of molecules with 3 properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow FBM (fractional brownian motion)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be bounded (3D by the cell boundary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molecule motion can change in time based on some user input
    probability of change to/from states (allowable states are the
    Diffusivity (<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{\mu m ^{2}}{s^{\alpha}}\)</span>) and the Hurst
    exponent characterizing the correlations in the process'
    increments (<span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model the motion of <em>condensates</em> (and their size). This dictates a
    preferential location inside the cell where the probability of
    observing a molecule is higher than the rest of the cell. Multiple
    number of condensates can coexist and move independently. The
    probability of <em>finding</em> a molecule is then set to a user defined
    value of the partition coefficient of the condensates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine these two underlying processes and create realistic Single
    Molecule Tracking Photoactivatible Localization Microscopy movies
    and images which can be used to train tracking methods or analysis
    methods for molecule trajectories and cluster detection. These need
    to incorporate the photo-physics of the probe used, along with the
    optics of the microscopy and camera detection. Namely, it needs to
    allow for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>motion blur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>defocus intensity decay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>defocus PSF deformation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>blinking (ON/OFF) of the probe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>::: info
This is not a technical document. I am not discussing how these features
are implemented (i think i came up with really nice solutions and would
love to talk about it) but to display the large functionality of this
code base and how <em>you</em> the user can interact with and use it for your
own means.

<h3 id="2_simulation_of_bounded_fbm_n-dimensional">2. Simulation of Bounded FBM (n-dimensional)<a class="headerlink" href="#2_simulation_of_bounded_fbm_n-dimensional" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>The first order of business is to confirm that SMS_BP can simulate
BM,FBM given some boundary. Here boundary conditions are implemented as
reflecting. For the included plots im showing only 2D motion because
it's easier to visualize but don't worry, the real simulation is 3D! In
fact using the nice property of stationary increments of FBM you can use
this to simulate n-dimensional motion (why you would want to do this I
don't know, but you can)!</p>
<p><img alt="Example of an effectively unconfined random motion where the

<p>I want to emphasize that I only used 4 unique states here. In fact the
user can ask for any combination of these (as many as you want) and the
probabilities are all handled under-the-hood. You do not need to worry
about typing anything other than the input parameters. I will discuss in
future sections how you can define the parameters of the simulations and
run it! By this point we have shown that the first goal is accomplished.
Lets move on to the condensate!</p>
<h3 id="3_condensate_definitions_and_movement">3. Condensate Definitions and Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#3_condensate_definitions_and_movement" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>So far we have worked with individual trajectories and let them start at
the origin. What if we want to simulate many trajectories (molecule
motion) but starting at different places in the cells? One choice is to
randomly sample the cellular space and start the observation of a
molecule. But if the underlying space is heterogeneous in the density of
molecules we are tracing we can define the cellular space as a
probability space. Each spatial element defines the <strong>expected</strong>
probability of finding a molecule in that region. This framework leads
to the definition of a condensate!</p>
<p>A <em>condensate</em> in the framework of SMS_BP is defined as a
circular/spherical region in the cell which has a higher probability per
unit volume to find a molecule. That it, so simple! The nice consequence
of using this simple definition is that we can also model the motion of
the condensate by using the probability space. By letting the
probability space be time dependent Figure 7 shows that we can treat the
condensate as a moving trajectory itself and using the framework we
developed previously to model its motion as BM or FBM! Isn't that cool?</p>
<p><img alt="Here we can simulate any number of condensates (here I show 2).
Implementation wise, their motion is independent of one another. But
using the framework of the FBM from before we can model the condensates
motion in anyway we like. Here one condensate is subdiffusive with a
small diffusion coefficient and one which is super-diffusive with a
larger diffusion coefficient. The blue lines represent the motion of the
centre of each condensate. The red circles show the extent of the
condensate boundary. In this case the size (radius) of the condensate
does not change in time. But rest assured, SMS_BP allows you to change
this as you like! Since these objects are built on the same framework as
the FBM, they share all the features of the molecule motion we outlined
before." src="../imgs/Confined_Condensates.pdf" />

<p>Again you should think of the condensate as a probability space which is
time and space dependent, <span class="arithmatex">\(p(s,t)\)</span>. This condensate movement occurs in
the background of the true molecule simulation and informs the location
of the individual molecule positions as they <em>turn on</em> to their
fluorescent state. This is parameterized by a probability density
defined by the user which we will talk about later. For now bask in the
glory that is SMS_BP.</p>
<h3 id="4_conversion_of_backend_trajectories_to_observable_palm-like_images">4. Conversion of Backend Trajectories to Observable PALM-like Images<a class="headerlink" href="#4_conversion_of_backend_trajectories_to_observable_palm-like_images" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Okay all of the previous features are considered the backend of the
simulation. They define what process are occurring. Our job now is to
express these processes in a way which is similar to what an
experimenter would observe from a typical SMT experiment. There are 3
things to consider: getting the photo-physics (intensities, PSF, etc ..)
correct, modelling the effect of motion blurring, and the affect of the
focal depth.</p>
<p>The first is not that hard, assuming we have knowledge of the properties
of the PSF and the intensities (photon counts) of individual molecule
localizations (at a given exposure) we can define the mean photons
emitted and captured at the detector in a time frame. The issue is the
motion blurring. Since this is affected by fast motion and corresponding
long exposures we actually sample the motion of the trajectories at a
smaller time resolution than the exposure time! For example, if the
exposure time is 100 ms the camera is on for 100 ms capturing photons
emitted. Meanwhile the underlying molecule is still moving so rather
than simulating the motion at 100 ms intervals we can simulate it at a
smaller interval (<span class="arithmatex">\(t &lt; 100ms\)</span>) and integrate the photons over the
exposure time, 100ms. For fast moving molecules which would resemble
comet tails as the intensity (the photons) would <em>leave</em> a trail of
photons in its wake over the time the detector is on.</p>
<p>SMS_BP allows the user to define the smaller sample time, <span class="arithmatex">\(t\)</span>. For
example, in Figure 8 I show the effect of a sample time smaller than the
exposure time. For visual aid I have cranked up the mean photons
emitted/captured to make the comet tail readily apparent. You can change
all these parameters, and we will do this in the final section.</p>
<p><img alt="Here the motion of a molecule is sampled every 1 ms. The exposure time
is 20 ms and there is no interval time between measurements. All three
of these parameters ca be user defined! Notice at this particualar frame
the PSF of the molecule appears distorted? This is because of motion
blur and defocus modelled by SMS_BP. For visual aid I have artificially
increased the mean photons emitted/captured for this molecule. The image
is slightly ugly due to png compression, but you will get to make your
own simulations and appreciate the
details." src="../imgs/Cell_Movie_Test_001_Motion_Blur_high.png" />

there is no PSF deformation in this frame, since the molecule is

that the over sampling (the \(t\) I discuss in the text) is the **same**
as the exposure time in this particular case. For visual aid I have

<h3 id="5_working_with_the_code">5. Working With the Code<a class="headerlink" href="#5_working_with_the_code" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>First things first: use the installing instructions in the main
README.md to get the conda environment created and the package installed
on your system. This allows you to use the functionality of SMS_BP from
anywhere since the path is appended to the main python search path.</p>
<p>There are 2 different ways to interact with the code.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the install we also install a CLI command <em>run_SMS_BP</em> which will
    work globally (you do not need to be in the directory of the
    project). You will need to provide a config file location to this
    command or it will be unhappy with you. You can run <em>run_SMS_BP --help</em>
    to see uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second is to use the actual code itself through import. We can
    do this since we have installed the code as a package.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To keep it simple for now let's focus on the first method. We can run the CLI command: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">run_SMS_BP config [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE]
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a template config file in the current directory if [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE] is set to ".". You can change the <strong>.</strong> to be a <strong>[PATH]</strong> to save the file elsewhere. In this newly created template file you will see a nested dictionary with a bunch of
parameters and associated values. We will go over each of these and what
values are allowable. The document <a href="../sim_config/">sim_config.md</a> is a text file
describing each parameter and the units of each parameter in our main
sim_config.json. Use it as a reference if you want to change any of the
parameters later on.</p>
<p>First of all. Let's change one parameter in the sim_config.json. Find
the set of parameters called \"Output_Parameters\". Inside you will find
a parameter called \"output_path\". Currently it contains a placeholder.
Change this to a string which is the absolute path of the place you want
SMS_BP to store the final results. So to reiterate change the string
<strong>\"\&lt;YOUR-PATH-HERE-CAN-BE-ABSOLUTE-OR-RELATIVE&gt;\"</strong> to the path you
want.</p>
<p>We can keep the rest of the parameters the same for now and let's just
run the simulation. Run using </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">run_SMS_BP runsim sim_config.json
</code></pre>
<p>Once the simulation
finishes you will find a new folder created at the path you specified
and inside a few files and folders. For now ignore the folders. The
.tiff file is the movie of the simulation. params_dump.json is a copy of
the sim_config.json used to create this particular simulation, it is
also provided as a pickle file. The final file Track_dump.pkl is the
true simulation of the underlying motion we did in section 1. This
allows you to track the PSFs in the movie and compare back to the true
positions of the molecules to see how well you did!</p>
<p>Let's redo this but now with the variable oversample_motion_time equal
to the exposure_time. Set both to 20 (ms). Notice any difference in the
two output movies? This is all I did to create figures 8-9.</p>
<p>To do further changes in the simulation I recommend reading the
sim_config.md file explaining the role of each parameter in the
sim_config.json file. If required I might make tutorials for other
features I did not discuss here.</p>
